Karen A. Humphrey (n√©e Doersam) passed away in her home in Union, Kentucky on September 28, 2020 at the age of 57.  She is survived by her children, Laura R. Humphrey and Paul M. Humphrey.  She is preceded in death by her parents, Henry F. Doersam and Dorothy B. Doersam, and her brother, Kevin Doersam.  She was born in Cleveland, Ohio and was a long time resident of Pickerington, Ohio. She loved parks and animals, working several years on a horse farm and then as a park ranger for the Ohio Metro Parks system. She also enjoyed spending time with friends at restaurants, bars, and other local hangouts, where she will surely be missed.
