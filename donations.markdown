    <h1>Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International (PATH Intl)</h1>

    <b>Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship
    International (PATH Intl.)</b>, a federally-registered 501(c3)
    nonprofit, was formed in 1969 as the North American Riding for the
    Handicapped Association to promote equine-assisted activities and
    therapies (EAAT) for individuals with special needs. With nearly
    4,800 certified instructors and equine specialists and 873 member
    centers, nearly 8,000 PATH Intl. members around the globe help
    almost 69,000 children and adults—including more than 6,700 veterans
    and active-duty military personnel—with physical, cognitive, and
    emotional challenges find strength and independence through the
    power of the horse each year. In addition to therapeutic riding, PATH
    centers offer a number of therapeutic equine-related activities,
    including hippotherapy, equine-facilitated mental health, driving,
    interactive vaulting, competition, ground work, and stable
    management. More recently, programs offer services in human growth
    and development to serve wide-ranging audiences for such educational
    purposes as leadership training, team building and other human
    capacity enhancement skills for the workplace and for daily
    use. Visit Path International
