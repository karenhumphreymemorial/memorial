  “When I was little, probably about seven years old, my brother and I went to visit my grandmother. We were only there for a few days before my brother got homesick, but I wanted to stay longer. So mom and grandma worked out a deal: grandma would drive us to meet mom halfway, then mom would take my brother home, and grandma would take me back to her house. Well, it didn’t work out that way! Thankfully grandma had the foresight to pack my bags, because once I saw my mom, I started tearing up and saying I wanted to go home too.

Unfortunately, there comes a time when it’s no longer possible to come home to your mom.


I don’t have any pictures of the three of us from that time period, but here’s one of us as adults at my wedding. I really miss them both.”
